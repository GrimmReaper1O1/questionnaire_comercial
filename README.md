The questionnaire is built to utilize a theory of memory, which allows for the cementation of memory via 
its usage to answer questions. Knowledge learnt from the subject page is thus utilized to answer a series of
quesitons based on such knowledge. 
The subject page is meant to consist of lengthy text and ment to overwhelm
the individual with information. Hints can be used to jog the memory of the student but should only be used to
initially mislead in order for the student to get the question wrong. Each individual quesiton set revolves. This 
is meant to be done on the first question. There should be at least four questions in each question set
based on information needed to solve each question. At the end of the quesiton set, information as a hint could 
be given which jogs the students memory in the right direction. 
There is an answer to every choice of quesiton and a reply to every choice of answer. These can be utilized to
remind the individual of both how they got something right and how they got something wrong. Information can be 
given to help them to get the answer correct but overall replys should not consist of all the information required 
to answer all the questions. Piece by piece you are meant to accumulate the information needed to answer the questions
correctly. This allows the student to read more informaiton and utilizes repetition in reading useful information in
order to learn and to learn the pitfalls of where people tend to get things wrong as well as cement the right information.
The question sets are to be answered correctly a number of times before the questions are labeled complete and you are
to move on to the next page, although you may choose to have as many questions on each page as the administrator likes. this
number of quesitons should be short enough to be motivational and allow you to move on, yet long enough for you to have 
trouble remembering the correct answer to previously asked questions on the next questionnaire pass.
The theory is that cementation allows you to draw your memory more quickly if it is utilized enough times to fully cement 
said memory; thus, you more quickly access memory in order to utilize it in any skill in formation including things 
like grammar, etc.

Not correct

I was going to have a shower but didn’t; consequently, I stank for the duration of the trip.
Reply 
Correct! A semi-column is utilized to end a sentence with words like consequently which then start another complete sentence with a comma after the word in question.

I was going off the rails; so, I punched him in the face about a thousand times.
Reply
Not correct. So is not one of those words it is a co-ordinating conjunctions.

The taste of honey was in the drink; it was a bitter sweet remembrance of long days past when times were better and the world was full of milk and honey like a sweet memory of the past, all but forgotten to the rigours of time.
Reply
Not correct. Although a semi-column can be used between two short sentences in relation to each other, the second sentence was far too long. Try to keep the sentences short and about the same length.


“””””

Our history was all but forgotten to the rigours of war. All but a bitter sweet memory of time long past within our sphere of recollection and that of which we most focus on in this day and age. It is; however, a simple time. We do what we are told for advancement or we are shot as traitors. The spoils of war fall upon us due to our advancement.
Reply
Not correct. Although however is one of these words it is not in the correct placement and is not considered essential information. A comma should have been used.
Hint
However is one of the words to use with the semi-column.

I need you to buy; milk, poultry, sour dough bread, coffee, a banjo, beef jerky, chocolate, glasses, wine, outdoor furniture, a jukebox or another kind of stereo, music to play or a spotify subscription, a mobile phone, honey, cake, and about fifty other things. We need them for the party; it's is your sons by the way.
Reply
Correct! You utilize the semi-column at the start of a long list and in between two short sentences in relation to each other.
Hint 
A semi-colun is used after a complete sentence with a conjunctive adverb.

There are administrative functions and a library, which if within a class will limit the shown books to the class.
You can alter or fill out the questionnaire in the administrative functions, but a subject must be taken down.
There is also a way to quickly learn multiplication or at least utilize the times tables for cementation.
There are three levels of administrative users to primarily protect students confidential information.
One is like the administrative assistant who can fill out quesitonnaires only. Another can view the recorded test results and search for students given they know their email or name. The last is all access. There is also an area where books can be uploaded and a style system to update the style of the page.

Although mostly functional the work is still incomplete and will take some time to get going.
The quesitonnaire is however somewhat functional as is the functionallity to fill them. There are php prototypes which are completely functional.
The style system has been updated to Javascript and there is now a drop down menu in the most current version.
Learning Javascript is tedious at best at the moment but then I've been doing it for less than two weeks. The Javascript in the questionnaire
is mostly functional but there are errors that I can't track down at this stage that don't happen often. It needs refactoring at which stage 
it will function differently and hopefully the errors will cease to exist. Thinking of separating the php pages to accomplish different aspects.


My apollogies, you will have to use the scheme document to fill the database and at this stage it may be erronious;
however, any web developer with sql skills can get it working quite easily. For the most part it's good to go in version 6.3.

The introduction to subjects page where there are images as apendixes isn't configured for the database entries but there is a table 
in the database to store them and a recent page to store apendixes; however, the page in quesiton is not complete in version 6.3.
It is however my next task to add audio and video as well as get the system to upload them function.

Please be aware the php interperater will need the php.ini file altered to accomodate for video files of your choice of size. I'm 
sticking to the size of 250 megabytes.

The style system isn't set up for the questionnaire as it requires refactoring and there is an error in the style configuration 
page which prevents the correct change in width for the introduction to subject page in relation to the bottom text box. Otherwise
there is much to be done to release a final version.
